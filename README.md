The gymnastics meets held in Gill Coliseum are fast paced, usually televised competitions attended by thousands of fans. In order to run the competitions smoothly and provide a positive experience for fans, athletes, and staff, there must be a way to record, organize, and display the scores that the judges give to each routine using the hardware already in Gill Coliseum. The Oregon State Gymnastics Team would like new scoring software. The pre-existing software used to display and keep scores has become outdated and has issues displaying on the current hardware. Because of this, it is important for new, custom software to be built that can accurately and elegantly display scores on Gill Coliseum's hardware in a readable manner that is intuitive for fans to understand while providing all the necessary functionality such as exporting to specific formats.
